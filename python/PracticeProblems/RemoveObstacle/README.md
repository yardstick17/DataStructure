# Description:

You are in charge of preparing a recently purchased lot for one of amazon's
new building. The lot is covered with trenches and has a single obstacle that
needs to be taken down before the foundation can be prepared for the building.
The demolition robot must remove the obstacle before progress can be made on
the building.
Write an algorithm to determine the minimum distance required for the
demolition robot to remove the obstacle.

# Assumptions:
1. The lot is flat, except for trenches, and can be represented as a 2-D grid.
2. The demolition robot must start from top left corner of the lot, which is
   always flat and can move one block up, down, right or left at a time.
3. The demolition robot cannot enter trenches and cannot leave the lot.
4. The flat areas are represented as 1, areas with trenches as 0 and
   obstacle by 9.

## Output:
Return an integer representing the minimum distance traversed to remove the
obstacle else return -1.
