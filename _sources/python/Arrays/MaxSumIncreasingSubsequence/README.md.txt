Problem Statement:

Given an array A of N positive integers. Find the sum of maximum sum increasing subsequence of the given array.

**Input:**

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is N(the size of array). The second line of each test case contains array elements.

**Output:**

For each test case print the required answer in new line.

_Constraints:_

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 106

Example:

**Input:**

2
7
1 101 2 3 100 4 5
4
10 5 4 3

**Output:**
